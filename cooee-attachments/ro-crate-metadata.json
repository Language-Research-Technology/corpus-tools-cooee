        "Material to be included had to meet with a regional and a temporal criterion. The latter required texts to have been produced between 1788 and 1900 in order to become eligible for COOEE. It was mandatory for a text to have been written in Australia, New Zealand or Norfolk Island. But in a few cases, other localities were allowed. For example, if a person who was a native Australian or who had lived in Australia for a considerable time, wrote a shipboard diary or travelled in other countries.\nContains: Letters, published materials in book form, historical texts. The collection is stratified in two ways:\n\nTime period - The corpus is divided into four time periods:\n\nPeriod 1: 1788-1825\nPeriod 2: 1826-1850\nPeriod 3: 1851-1875\nPeriod 4: 1876-1900\n\nThe initial numeral of each file name indicates the period from which the document comes.\nRegister - The corpus contains material from four registers:\nSpeech-based (sb)\nPrivate written (prw)\nPublic written (pcw)\nGovernment English (ge)\nThe register to which a file belongs is specified in the metadata at the start of each file in the form <r=[register]> using the abbreviations above."
